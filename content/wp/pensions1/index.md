abstract: "In a fully funded defined contribution (FDC) pension scheme, pensions depend only on idiosyncratic elements. As a result, pension inequality reflects productivity differences across individual in the society. In this paper, we assess the macroe- conomic and welfare consequences of introducing a collective defined contribution (CDC) scheme. This is aimed to reduce pension inequality within the FDC pension system, by redistributing more resources to low productivity pensioners. We find that the introduction of CDC increases the stock of capital and aggregate GDP in the economy. At the same time, it generates a decline in private savings, with no significant changes in consumption. This policy is, in the aggregate, welfare improving, although high productivity workers reduce their consumption level and their welfare. In the absence of a CDC scheme, a reduction in pension inequality could be achieved through increase in taxes. This, however, reduces welfare for both, low-productivity and high- productivity workers. The decline in welfare is more severe if taxes to capital are chosen as the instrument. Taxes on labor and on consumption reduce welfare less severely, but are still inefficient policies compared to the introduction of a CDC scheme."
